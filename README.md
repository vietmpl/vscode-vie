## Motivation
Developers often waste time writing repetitive boilerplate and setting up project structures. The motivation behind this project is to create a toolchain that automates these repetitive workflows through a template language. Such a system aims to help developers focus on solving real problems rather than rewriting structural code, while ensuring consistency, scalability, and maintainability within and across teams on project.

## Key features
- Fast CLI, formatter and templating engine powered by Go and Tree-sitter–based parsing.
- Own-designed simple, clear and expressive template language.
- Automatic argument type system for safer and more predictable generation.
- Zero configuration required — works out of the box.
